## Docker Install

### Windows

* Need to install [WSL2 on Windows 10 or above](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/how-to-install-wsl2-on-windows-10)
* Install [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)

### MacOS

* Simply install [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
* Ensure that you pick the correct installer based on whether you have an Intel based Mac on one with Apple Silicon (M1/M2/etc)


### Linux
